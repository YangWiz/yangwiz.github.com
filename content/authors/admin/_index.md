Hi there! I'm a second-year Computer Science Master's student at VU Amsterdam. My track focuses on computer systems and infrastructure. I'm currently supervised by [Prof. Andres Goens](https://goens.org/) on topics related to [AQL](https://goens.org/publications/zhang-pact-24/PACT24.pdf) and the [Compound Memory Model](https://goens.org/publications/goens-pldi-23/). 
Previously, I worked at CARIAD as a cybersecurity engineer internship student under the supervision of [Dr. Ilya Orerov](https://www.crypto.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/staff/ozerov.html.en), where I developed a TLS-PSK MITM attack script. You can find my script on my [GitHub](https://github.com/YangWiz). 
I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from [Qingdao University of Science and Technology](https://en.qust.edu.cn/), where I made some of the best friends of my life.
I'm generally interested in storage systems, heterogeneous multicore systems, formal verification, and HW/SW co-design.
