Hi there! I'm a second-year Computer Science Master's student at [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl) and [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). My track focuses on computer systems and infrastructure. I'm currently supervised by [Prof. Andres Goens](https://goens.org/) on topics (HDL Backend) related to [AQL](https://goens.org/publications/zhang-pact-24/PACT24.pdf). I will be starting as an SDE intern at [Volvo Cars](https://www.volvocars.com/en/) in Gothenburg in February 2025, where I will work on the fast charging system. 

Previously, I worked at [CARIAD](https://cariad.technology/) as a cybersecurity engineer internship student under the supervision of [Dr. Ilya Ozerov](https://www.crypto.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/staff/ozerov.html.en), where I developed a TLS-PSK MITM attack script. You can find my script on my [GitHub](https://github.com/YangWiz). I also worked as a Rust backend software engineering intern at the AI startup [BaihaiAI](https://github.com/BaihaiAI/IDP). 

I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from [Qingdao University of Science and Technology](https://en.qust.edu.cn/), where I made some of the best friends of my life.

I'm generally interested in storage systems, heterogeneous multicore systems, formal verification, and HW/SW co-design.

#### TAing
- [Security of Systems and Networks](https://www.os3.nl/start) .Fall 2024

#### Research Projects
- Implementation of the AQL Compiler's CIRCT Backend [[code](https://github.com/YangWiz/aql-circt)] [[report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ISfj9GLfG4aHgvLpCKjxev_HFPw9VjJI/view?usp=drive_link)]
- Secure the Memory System with Affine Type for Nano Language (TBD)

#### Advanced University Projects

Sadly most of these contain no links to source code or report as to prevent plagarism for future students, but you can find parts of them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/YangWiz).

- MOESI Cache simulator (discrete-event with accurate timings)
- NVMe userspace FTL (GC) and log-structured NVMe file system for RocksDB
- An SMT solver using DPLL(T) and a VCGen based on Hoare logic with the weakest precondition approach.
- A simple to-do list application with persistent storage (psql) deployed on GCP using K8s, secured with TLS via cert-manager and RBAC. 
- RISC-V Implementations of KATAN32 and RECTANGLE Ciphers, and a Verilog Implementation of the PRESENT Cipher with Masked S-Box.
- EdgeCoolingMode thermal management algorithm based on HotSniper framework.
